Manage WordPress signups via WP-Cron.

![](./screenshot.png)

## Description

Enable a cron event that will remove active and/or pending signups from the database.

## Features

* Displays information about the signups table such as size and number of signups.
* Enable or disable removal of active and pending signups independently.
* Set separate thresholds for how old the signups should be before removal.
* Choose to email a report to the Site Admin.
* Set how often the cron event will run and see when the next event is scheduled for.

## Installation

The Boilerplate can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is". You will want to rename it and the classes inside of it to fit your needs. For example, if your plugin is named 'example-me' then:

* rename files from `plugin-name` to `example-me`
* change `plugin_name` to `example_me`
* change `plugin-name` to `example-me`
* change `Plugin_Name` to `Example_Me`
* change `PLUGIN_NAME_` to `EXAMPLE_ME_`

It's safe to activate the plugin at this point. Because the Boilerplate has no real functionality there will be no menu items, meta boxes, or custom post types added until you write the code.
